## Hi there!

Previously, I was an independent game developer, working on a wide variety of projects, both for-hire and for the [small studio](https://wefiends.com) I founded.

My profile contains public repos of a wide variety of work, from native C++ libraries to full-stack SaaS apps.

You can find more info about me [here](http://nicholasbarrios.com) or contact me at [nick@nicholasbarrios.com](mailto:nick@nicholasbarrios.com).
